      "description": "Recharge is an interactive proof of concept for users who drive electric vehicles in Amsterdam to report problems that occur when trying to charge their electric cars. It is a web application with an app and a dashboard. The app provides easy access for electric car drivers so that they can quickly share their complaints. With the most common problems already provided as standard options, they can immediately report it and find the nearby charging station where the issue occurs. The dashboard is for the companies involved in the charging stations, and they are responsible for maintaining them. The dashboard gives them insight into all the issues at the moment that occurs. More information is available in the project repository where the design choices are documented.",
